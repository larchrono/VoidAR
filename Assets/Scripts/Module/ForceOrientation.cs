// This is used to workaround https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-changing-the-screen-orientation-via-a-script-sometimes-results-in-corrupted-view-on-ios-10
// Bug shows screen in portrait with content rotated 90 offscreen. Caused by explicitly setting Landscape orientation on iOS 10.
// 
// On iOS this just switches to LandscapeLeft, back to Portrait, and then back to LandscapeLeft, which seems to work.
// SUGGESTION: blank out the screen before executing this, since the screen jumps around as it switches back and forth.
